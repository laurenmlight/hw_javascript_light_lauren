## Comments
I was not able to complete part 6c as requested. I could not figure out how to name a function and a parameter the same name. I would appreciate seeing an example of how to do this, as I could not find one in the lectures.

I would have appreciated if the previous homework was graded prior to the submission of this one, to allow me to learn from my mistakes.
